Replaces current line with a random joke from a public API

This works by either: 

* writing //joke comment on a line and then saving the file, or
* executing `Tools -> Replace selection with a random joke` command from the menu

Also, there's a panel that shows all previously retrieved Jokes. It is located under `(View -> Other Windows -> Jokes Panel)`
